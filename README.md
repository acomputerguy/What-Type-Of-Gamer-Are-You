Q: Why did you make this?

A: I wanted to come up with an idea that hasn't been done before with Steam APIs!
Most ideas with market bots and SteamDB have already been done before.

Q: Do you store my steam keys?

A: No, and what's in the code is in the binary. It's impossible to know for sure unless you reverse engineer the binary!

Q: How are you grabbing information?

A: I use genres and not user-defined tags. Tags have no regulation and are not 
accessible via Steam APIs which make the games difficult to compare.
These community-defined tags can lead to questionable values
